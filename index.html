            <p>Hello, my name is <strong> Victoria Echebima.</strong> I am a student at ENSG currently learning

        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Victoria Echebima was born on April 23, 2002, in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. She hails from
                <strong>Egbu in Owerri North L.G.A ,Imo state </strong> where she was raised in a supportive family environment that valued hardwork,faith, education, and service to others. Her journey refelects <em> resilience, compassion and bold ambition</em>. Growing up, she developed a deep sense of care for others and a strong work ethic that shaped her early path in healthcare. Nursing became more than just a profession for Victoria- it was a calling rooted in service, empathy, and the desire to make a meaning difference in people's lives.
            </p>
            <p> While building her career in healthcare, Victoria discovered a new passion for technology and
                problem-solving. Fascinated by the power of digital innovation, she made the courageous decision to transition into full stack development. Balancing the demands of nursing with learning programming, she embraced the challenge with determination and curioisity. Her journey into tech represents not just a career shift, but a powerful expansion of her impact- from caring for patients physically to building solutions that can improve lives on a broader scale.</p>
            
                <p> Today, Victoria stands at the intersection of healthcare and technology, inspired by the possibilities ahead. Her story is one of growth, reinvention, and fearless pursuit of purpose. As she continues her transition into full stack development, she's proving that its never too late to evolve, dream bigger and build a future that reflects both passion and potential.</p>
